# Giant Number Display (nums)

Giant controllable numbers on screen. Ideal setup is a big screen TV attached to a PC. It can be used
as a resource coordinator, like client (customer) queue announcement. 

The numbers can be controlled over the LAN with the 'numcli' network client program. (see screen shots)

This project contains the source, but one needs the only three files. 

	  -  .\notify1.wav
	  -  .\Release\nums.exe
	  -  .\numscli\Release\numcli.exe

	  
 The sound file (optional) named notify1.wav will be played when the number display is updated. 
 One may replace the file with a different sound as needed.
